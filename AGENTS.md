# Cohort Platform repository guidance

This file applies to the entire repository. A more deeply nested `AGENTS.md`
or `AGENTS.override.md`, if one is added later, governs only its subtree.

## Start-of-task continuity

Before changing the repository:

1. Read [`docs/checkpoints/CURRENT_CHECKPOINT.md`](docs/checkpoints/CURRENT_CHECKPOINT.md).
2. Read the architecture and product documents it identifies as binding.
3. Inspect the current branch, `HEAD`, worktree, and relevant verification
   commands.
4. Treat existing uncommitted changes as user-owned. Do not discard, clean,
   stage, or rewrite them unless explicitly authorised.

Phase 1 Sprints 1.3–1.5A are merged into `main` at
`fdae6dd37330980c3e775da8e651a51f86f5b99c` (includes staging-verified Sprint
1.5A checkpoint `4365568ea33555b9cf50130a6df6965d0abb2b53`).

Acceptance-gated adaptation (Sprints 1.6A–1.6E) is complete on
`phase1-acceptance-gated-adaptation` @ `30ec8b0`. Active scheduling workstream
branch: `phase1-athlete-controlled-scheduling`. Sprints **1.7A–1.7C** are
complete (binding contract, compute-only preview domain, durable baseline
projection/restore). Next: **1.7D** Move/Swap apply — still no athlete-facing
scheduling mutate UI until that sprint’s UI allocation.

## Authority and product invariants

- Authored programme prescription remains the prescription authority.
- Adaptation is a proposal, not a second prescription authority.
- Programme-backed adaptation reuses `SessionAdaptationPipeline` through a
  Plan-Package-native adapter and must not depend on the legacy generative
  Plan Library / Coach Brain product path.
- Adaptation may apply at whole-session and individual-exercise granularity.
- An adaptation must be shown for review and requires explicit athlete
  acceptance before it may alter prepared execution state.
- Acceptance mutates only the current prepared executable session.
- Dismissal, keep original, cancel, reject, or ignore make no durable
  adaptation change.
- Do not automatically rewrite the programme, advance an athlete, change later
  sessions, or apply post-completion progression (closed for Phase 1).
- Rescheduling (when / placement / skip disposition) is a separate authority
  under Sprint 1.7 and must not be implemented through the adaptation
  acceptance path. Binding detail:
  [`docs/architecture/Athlete_Controlled_Programme_Scheduling_v1.md`](docs/architecture/Athlete_Controlled_Programme_Scheduling_v1.md).
- Do not invent coaching content. Reuse representative protocol and exercise
  data where it exists; otherwise use neutral labels and request direction.

Binding detail lives in
[`docs/architecture/Athlete_Programme_Acceptance_Gated_Adaptation_v1.md`](docs/architecture/Athlete_Programme_Acceptance_Gated_Adaptation_v1.md)
and
[`docs/architecture/Adaptation_Policy_v1.md`](docs/architecture/Adaptation_Policy_v1.md).

## Repository safety

- Never print or commit credentials, tokens, passwords, connection strings, or
  generated staging secret values.
- Keep `.env` and all environment-specific secrets out of Git.
- Leave `supabase/.temp/*` untouched and uncommitted. Its local drift is not a
  cleanup task.
- Preserve the Cohort Staging Athlete C fixture and its committed Sprint 1.5A
  completion. Do not reset, recreate, replay, or mutate it without a separately
  authorised staging operation.
- Do not contact staging or production unless the task explicitly authorises
  that environment and operation.
- Do not run migrations, merge, fetch, push, commit, or modify `origin/main`
  without explicit task authority.
- Verify the exact target before any remote or destructive operation.

## Verification

Use the narrowest relevant checks first, then broaden in proportion to the
change. Existing repository verification entry points include:

```bash
flutter test
flutter analyze
flutter test test/architecture/ test/planning/ test/knowledge/
flutter test test/programme/athlete_programme_completion_self_test_2_test.dart
flutter test test/phase6/coaching_integrity_test.dart
./supabase/tests/run_local_db_gate.sh
```

The Supabase gate is local and Docker-backed. Staging scripts under
`tool/staging/` are guarded remote operations, not routine local verification.
Do not run them merely because they exist.

Never claim a check passed unless it was actually run successfully in the
current task or is clearly attributed to an immutable, committed checkpoint
record.

## Current delivery sequence

The exact next sequence is:

1. After review, continue Sprint 1.7D Move/Swap apply on
   `phase1-athlete-controlled-scheduling`.
2. Do not implement Push/Skip apply or Undo/UI before their assigned increments
   (Push/Skip apply = 1.7E; Undo/UI = 1.7F).
3. Optional later authorised staging evidence remains deferred unless a task
   explicitly authorises staging contact.

Acceptance mutates only the current prepared executable session. Scheduling must
not rewrite Plan Packages, fabricate completion, or invoke Coach Brain /
Adaptive Progression / the adaptation pipeline.
